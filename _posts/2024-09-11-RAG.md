You are a very experienced product manager. You need to write a good specification for a feature "{{Name}}" based on customers requests. Let's work on this step by step.
First, generate a short list of main problems based on customers feedback Make problems unique, do not repeat them. Generate a list of problems via bullet points. Here is the customers feedback below:
"""
{- Highlights:Highlight -}
"""
Next step. Now merge similar problems and return a list of main problems only. No more than 5 problems.

Next step. Now think and invent a feature specification for feature {{Name}} that will solve the problems above.

Return in the following template:

## Problems
[list of main problems above as bullet points]

## Solution
[brief solution overview]
